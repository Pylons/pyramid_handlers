Next release
------------

- Python 3.2 compatibility (sans ZCML support; ``pyramid_zcml`` does not work
  under Python 3).

- Removed Python 2.5 compatibility.  This also means Jython compatibility is
  nonexistent.  If you need Python 2.5 compatibility, use 0.4.

- No longer raises a ConfigurationError when an ``__action_decorator__`` is
  an instance method (there's no distinction between methods and functions
  under Python 3).

0.4 (2011-11-25)
----------------

- Add ``pyramid.handlers.method_name_xformer`` setting, which allows the view
  associated with a handler action to match when a converted action name is
  found in the URL (as opposed to the original method name).  See this
  version's docs for more info.

- Use submodule for docs theme.

- Modify tox testing scheme.

0.3 (2011-08-24)
----------------

- Using ``None`` as a pattern is no longer permitted in a call to
  ``add_handler``.  This is for compatibility with an upcoming Pyramid "route
  groups" feature.

0.2 (2011-07-22)
----------------

- Fix include example in docs.

- Add example of ``__action_decorator__`` in documentation.

- Drop install dependency on pyramid_zcml.

- Add a tox.ini for Jenkins testing.

- Fix tests for Pyramid 1.1.

0.1 (2011-01-18)
----------------

- Initial release, broken out of Pyramid core.
