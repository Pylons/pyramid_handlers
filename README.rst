``pyramid_handlers``
====================

``pyramid_handlers`` is a package which allows Pyramid to largely emulate the
functionality of Pylons 1 "controllers".  Handlers are a synthesis of
Pyramid *url dispatch* and method introspection of a view class that makes it
easier to create bundles of view logic which reacts to particular route
patterns.  It works under Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2.
